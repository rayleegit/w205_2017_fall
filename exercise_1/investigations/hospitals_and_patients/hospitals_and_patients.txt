# hospitals and patients answer

The 'Hospital General Information' table
'Patient experience national comparison' and
'Hospital overall rating' fields are great for answering this question.
To see if there is a correlation between average hospital ratings and
patient experience, we may simply compute the average 'Hospital overall rating'
for each 'Patient experience national comparison' value.

To do this, we must first transform the 'Hospital overall rating' field
from 'string' to 'int'. There are 1,252 'Not Available' values in this field,
out of 4,812 records - one may assume that not all hospitals have an overall
rating.

Once we transform the data, we then simply query (referenced in
hospitals_and_patients.sql) the average 'Hospital overall rating' for each
'Patient experience national comparison' value. When we do this, we find that
'Patient experience national comparison' is in fact positively correlated with
average scores for hospital quality:
  'Above the national average'	3.676252319109462
  'Same as the national average'	3.0859167404782992
  'Below the national average'	2.4139534883720932.
