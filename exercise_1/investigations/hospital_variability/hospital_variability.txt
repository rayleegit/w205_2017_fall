# Raymond lee hospital variability answer

The 'Timely and Effective Care - Hospital' table contains hospital-specific
scores for a variety measures. To see which measures have the highest
variability, one method to do this would be to identify the measures that have
the highest score range (difference between maximum score and minimum score).

The first step to do this is to transform the scores into integers. Out of
105,865 records, there are 52,863 records with a 'Not Available' 'Score'. This
is a significant number of records, but does not prevent us from continuing
our analysis - not all hospitals have scores for every measure. There are also
a few more 'Score' values that are not a numerical value - we may exclude these
because we won't be able to calculate a significant, comparable range for these
measures:
  'High (40,000 - 59,999 patients annually)' (598 records)
  'Medium (20,000 - 39,999 patients annually)' (961 records)
  'Very High (60,000+ patients annually)'	(680 records)
  'Low (0 - 19,999 patients annually)'	(1211 records).

The measures that have the highest variability (referenced in
'hospital_variability.sql') are 'ED1' (1,209 range),'ED2' (628 range),
'OP 18' (395 range), 'Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute
Coronary Intervention' (393 range), and so on.
