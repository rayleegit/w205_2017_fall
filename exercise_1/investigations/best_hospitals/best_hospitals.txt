# best hospitals answer

The 'HVBP_HCAHPS...' table, which contains patient experience domain measures
is great for answering this question because the 'HCAHPS Consistency Score'
field indexes each hospital based on its consistency across different measures.

Through a cursory review, it appears that 'HCAHPS Consistency Score' is
positively correlated with 'Overall Rating of Hospital Dimension Score'.
Therefore, one may assume that the highest 'HCAHPS Consistency Score' a hospital
may earn is 20.

Out of 2,955 values, there are only 6 'Not Available' values. This provides
adequate confidence in the data quality.

A query (referenced in best_hospitals.sql) on the 'HVBP_HCAHPS...' table, with a
filter on 'HCAHPS Consistency Score' equal to 20, returns 559 hospitals - these
are the hospitals that have the most consistently high scores for a variety of
procedures. Some of the hospitals included in this list are Franciscan Health
Carmel, Anna Jaques Hospital, Hancock Regional Hospital, and Pinnacle Hospital.
